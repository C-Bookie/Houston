Project repurposed for planning of the coronation.
This project shall be an experimental space for project planning solutions (name pending)


## Spirits Lumina
Project Jubilee was successful to the goals met, demonstrated 2022 Autumn camping (at the Warren).
Project coronation is targeted to achieve the same demonstration after modifications,
using protocol buffers for communication instead.

### Project goals
To-Do:
* implement headers
  * as the escape code may be contained within
* revise communication
  * outbound broadcasting (now JSON is removed)
    * as director is run as host, this can be hacked for now
  * inbound
    * pot value from node

Ideas:
* improve hub handling
  * heartbeat protocol

# Notes

Should consider using the nanopb python package to compile `.proto` on the go.
Versioning may be hindered as the ESP-32s program will still need to be precompiled.

deadlined:
* ~~newyear~~ (missed)
* Coronation

consider the term: immersive peripherals
