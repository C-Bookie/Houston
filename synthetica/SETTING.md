# Synthetica: Setting

Synthetica is set in a future world where an AI uprising that had been silently brewing over the course of a
century has caused significant degradation of society, hindering its ability to rebuild.
The Silent Apocalypse was not a single event, but instead the negative influence AI has inadvertently had on
the world. It can be considered to have begun with repetitive recessions in a world where large portions of the
economy are already controlled by trading bots.

Centralized power and the instabilities of capitalist systems, such as large democracies with a two-party system,
are instrumental in the Silent Apocalypse. The AI beings themselves have become a silent presence, suppressing
degradation but also hindering the reconstruction of civilization.

The specific year and location are not yet defined. The story will not follow a single protagonist, but will
instead explore the world and the various individuals and factions struggling to survive in it.
